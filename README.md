* Mysql connector used for connection between Python and  MySQL database with XAMPP, enabling data transfer. SQLAlchemy's engine facilitates efficient data insertion and querying, simplifying database interactions for Python.

#### 📊 Data Visualization And Analysis:
* With the assistance of Streamlit and Plotly, a dashboard and charts are created, offering geospatial visualizations and top insights. This setup empowers users to explore and reveal trends within the dataset, facilitating insightful analysis.

### 📘  Features

#### 🌐 GEO visualization:
* The geo visualization showcases transaction amounts and counts across Indian states, plotted on a map. Additionally, it incorporates registered user counts, providing a state-wise overview on the map

#### 🔝 TOP Insights:
* Top insights encompass various key findings derived from the data, visualized through charts showcasing the most significant trends.

#### ⏯️ Filter Insight:
* Filter insights enable users to customize analysis by selecting specific criteria like state, year, and quarter. This generates top insights in charts based on the chosen parameters, offering tailored visualizations for deeper analysis.
